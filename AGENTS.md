# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

- Prefer descriptive docstrings for all public functions and classes.
- Use type hints for function signatures and class attributes when possible.
- Keep modules importable without executing network calls at import time.
- When adding dependencies, update both `requirements.txt` and any relevant documentation.
- Run `python -m compileall src` before committing changes.
